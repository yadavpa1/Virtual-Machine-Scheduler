# Virtual-Machine-Scheduler

- - Implemented a vector bin packing algorithm for optimal virtual machine placement to minimize the active physical machines and the number of migrations for physical machine consolidations with the objective of reducing the energy consumption in a data center significantly.
- - Built a UI portal to demo the algorithm that also allows performing CRUD operations on an inventory of objects like datacenter, cluster, host, and a virtual machine with RBAC support.
